## Summary
#### One drawback of this new design and two recommendations
- The very noticeable drawback is that you need to specify the exact date of the UFO sighting. If you do not know the exact date, but only recognize the month of the sighting, you will need to search every date of the month to filter the exact sighting you want to filter out.

- First recommendation of the project is that you should enable date search based on a start and end date instead of a one specific date. This way, if you are unsure of the exact date, you can still enter the approximate to narrow your date search. It should also enable a single date filter by entering the same date in start/end date.

- Second recommendation of the project is to make the city name search more user friendly. If a city name has two words, such as "Lemon Grove", the filter function should allow the user to filter the city with only a single word such as "Lemon" or "Grove". The city, state and country filter should also allow the user to easily navigate the filter without being case sensitive.
